          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            Each side of the table alternates serving two points at a time.
            EXCEPTION: After tied 10-10 ("deuce"), service alternates at every
            point. Can you lose on a serve in ping pong? Yes! There is no
            separate rule for serving on Game Point.

          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            Hold the ball in your open palm, behind your end of the table. Toss
            at least 6" straight up, and strike it on the way down. It must hit
            your side of the table and then the other side. NOTE: Once the ball
            leaves the server's hand it is in play, and so counts as the
            receiver's point if the ball is missed or mis-hit.

            4. The Serve Can Land Anywhere in Singles
          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            There is no restriction on where the ball lands on your side or your
            opponent's side of the table. It can bounce two or more times on
            your opponent's side (if so, that's your point), bounce over the
            side, or even hit the edge.

          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            The serve must bounce in the server's right court, and receiver's
            right court (NOTE: landing on center line is fair). Doubles partners
            switch places after their team serves twice.

            6. A Serve That Touches the Net on the Way Over is a "Let"
          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            Can the ball hit the net in ping pong? Yes, during a RALLY, if it
            touches the top of the net and then otherwise lands as a legitimate
            hit. BUT not when serving. If a served ball hits the net on the way
            over and otherwise legally bounces in play, it's a "let" serve and
            is done over. There is no limit on how many times this can happen.

          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            Can you hit the ball before it bounces in ping pong? No. In regular
            tennis you may "volley" the ball (hitting the ball before it bounces
            on your side of the net). But in table tennis, this results in a
            point for your opponent. NOTE: When your opponent hits a ball that
            sails over your end of the table without touching it and then hits
            you or your paddle, that is still your point.

            9. If Your Hit Bounces Back Over the Net by Itself It Is Your Point
          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            If you hit the ball in a rally or on a serve and it bounces back
            over the net after hitting your opponent's side of the table (due to
            extreme spin), without your opponent touching it, that is your
            point.

            10. Touching the Ball with Your Paddle Hand is Allowed
          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            If the ball touches your PADDLE hand and otherwise results in a
            legal hit, there is no rule violation and play shall continue as
            normal. Your paddle hand includes all fingers and hand area below
            the wrist. But what if the ball touches a player's body anywhere
            else during a ping pong rally? You may not touch the ball with your
            non-paddle hand for any reason. It will result in a point for your
            opponent. BUT if your opponent's hit sails over your side of the
            table without touching it, and hits any part of you or your paddle,
            that is still your point.

            You may touch the ball or the table with your paddle hand (after
            reaching in to return a short serve, for example), or other parts of
            your body. NOTE: If the table moves at all from your touching it
            during a rally, that is your opponent's point.

            An otherwise legal serve or hit may contact the top edge of the
            horizontal table top surface and be counted as valid, even if it
            bounces sidewise. The vertical sides of the table are NOT part of

          </h2>
          <p className="pl-5">
            If no referee is present during a match and the players disagree on
            a certain call, the "honor system" applies and the players should
            find a way to agree, or play the point over. Ping pong carries a
            tradition of fierce but fair play. Help us keep it that way!
